        <p> Welcome to Pat's Salmon Cookies, the most delicious treat in Seattle Washington. Our treats can be found in several locations  around the Washington State area. Pat has developed a recipe for a coffee-time confection called Salmon Cookies, cookies made into the shape of a salmon, and actually made with salmon (though the fish is ground up so fine that you can't even taste it!) that is the ideal match for a steaming cup of coffee on a gray Seattle morning.</p>
